Extension to finish translating the incomplete World of Cultivation translation. For chrome/vivaldi: http://media.rhizzone.net/woc_translate.zip

Install Instructions:

1. Drag folder out of zip to somewhere, like your home directory or My Documents or whatever.
2. Open your extensions tab by the menu or typing "chrome://extensions" or "vivaldi://extensions" in the url bar
3. Check "developer mode" and then click "Load unpacked extensions"
4. Choose the folder you dragged out earlier
5. Reload the page, e.g. https://wwyxhqc.wordpress.com/2015/12/12/修真世界-world-of-cultivation-chapter-one-to-five/

I added whatever was in the "glossary", and I'll update this with more if I missed anything that comes up later.
